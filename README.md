# rfc7030-est-client

Library and client implementation of EST Enrollment Protocol RFC 7030 [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030.html](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030.html)

## Why another EST Client
Actually the standard reference implementation [https://github.com/cisco/libest](https://github.com/cisco/libest) 
is very complex (Android support, BRSKI support, ...).

Another problem with libest is the SSL library implementation used: openssl. Currently is the only supported backend and change this is not so easy (the code is made by openssl calls).

In the IoT world, we have devices with different SSL libraries (e.g. WolfSSL, BoringSSL, MbedTLS...) or different platforms that need non-standard compilation methods or build chainsd (e.g. FreeRTOS and some market PLCs).

To support different platforms and libraries we need a 'pluggable' and configurable client.

## The project
This repository contains some parts of the EST rfc implementation:
- Low level library
- SSL/X.509 Backend agnostic client logic
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Command line blueprint client

### Low level library and SSL/X.509 Backend agnostic client logic
<b>src/lib</b> folder, contins the real EST implementation and a partial implementation for an EST client.

Library is a very low level set of methods prefixed by est_xxx which implements all technical parts of the protocol, for example
est_connect or est_cacert. These functions only implements specific parts of the RFC so its difficoult to use them directly.

In this folder you can find a first level client implementation; this client is agnostic regarding the SSL library used and MUST be used only as a support for the real client. Client functions uses a standard prefix est_client_xxx.

### Unit tests and Integration tests
The two folders <b>src/test</b> and <b>src/integration</b> contains the code used to run all tests. Both produces an executable.

Tests are implemented using a specific backend implemenation so if you want to support a new SSL or X.509 technology you need to implementa test functions also.

Integration tests runs with the http://testrfc7030.com est server so an internet connection is mandatory.

### Dependencies
The client library uses only 1 third parts dependency and is a compile dependency.

You can find the picohttpparser library as a git submodule in the src/third_party folder. No additional dependency are used.

At runtime, the clients needs only a backend library implementation, such as OpenSSL, to run.

## Available SSL/X.509 Backends
As described before, the EST library (and the client you can find in the src/lib folder) is agnostic about the SSL/X.509 implementation. This provides the freedom to port the code to every platform you want or need.

To support this requirement there are several opaque types that must be implemented using the SSL/X.509 implementation.

You can find the description for every type in the header file as a comment.

### OpenSSL
Located in <b>src/openssl</b>, is the implementation of all EST SSL and X.509 operations used by the EST.

- *_x509.c: this file contains the OpenSSL code to parse and manage X.509 objects. Current objects are certificates, pkcs7 containers and certificate stores.

- *_tls.c: this file contains the OpenSSL code to init and configure a TLS connection.

- *_rfc.c: the implementation of the EST client based on the OpenSSL layer.

- *_test.c: functions used to execute tests (unit and integrations).

rfc7030-est-client

Library and client implementation of EST Enrollment Protocol RFC 7030 
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030.html

Why another EST Client
Actually the standard reference implementation [https://github.com/cisco/libest](https://github.com/cisco/libest) 
is very complex (Android support, BRSKI support, ...).

Another problem with libest is the SSL library implementation used: openssl. Currently is the only supported backend and change this is not so easy (the code is made by openssl calls).

In the IoT world, we have devices with different SSL libraries (e.g. WolfSSL, BoringSSL, MbedTLS...) or different platforms that need non-standard compilation methods or build chainsd (e.g. FreeRTOS and some market PLCs).

To support different platforms and libraries we need a 'pluggable' and configurable client.
